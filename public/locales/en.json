  "about-description": "Hello! My name is Renan Andrade de Gouveia, a Rio-born developer passionate about technology, design, and gamification. As a Front-End Developer, I specialize in creating intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences using React and TypeScript. Throughout my career, I've worked on projects ranging from legacy system migrations to modern architectures, Figma interface design, and API integrations with platforms like Google Maps and Pagar.me. I also have experience with Laravel, Node.js, and Shopify development, always striving to balance functionality, performance, and user-centered design. When I'm not coding or designing interfaces, I enjoy playing video games, attending music concerts, and immersing myself in samba culture.",
